            <h4>The Gathering Place Mission</h4>
            <p>The Gathering Place, located at 339 Bourbon St in Georgetown, Ky, serves the community with a homeless shelter and community kitchen. Originally, the shelter was only open to men, but after fundraising and volunteer work, they opened a women's shelter in December of 2017. The Women's Shelter is located in a separate building at 115 N Water Street in Georgetwon as well. The community kitchen serves as a place for people to get a hot meal who otherwise might not be able to eat.</p>
                
            <p>From the official website of the Gathering Place Mission: "Our primary goals for 2018 are to continue providing shelter and support for homeless men and women and to provide at least one hot meal each day of the week.  The Gathering Place Mission will continue to address drug addiction problems in our community and to be a place where individuals can find new hope and get their feet back on the ground.</p>

            <p>Our mission is to share God’s Plan and love one another; to offer food, meet personal needs, provide emergency shelter, case management, and service referrals to connect with appropriate resources to enable a person to move from shelter dependency to self-sufficiency in the Scott County community."</p>
            
            <h4>PHA's Involvement</h4>
            <p>Our fraternity will be volunteering our time to help with daily tasks at the various locations, as well as raising money to donate to the operation expenses of the shelter.</p>
