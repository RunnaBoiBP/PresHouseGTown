            <h1>PHA History: 1964-Present Day</h1>
            <p>The President's House Association was founded in 1964 by Georgetown College student Paul Corts. He created the organization with the idea that being in a fraternity meant more than being Greek. It is about being involved in a brotherhood that strives for the betterment of each individual and the organization as a whole. These beliefs are reflected in the three organizational pillars--Academics, Brotherhood, and Christianity. As a House, members personify these beliefs by motivating each other to become better scholars, brothers, and citizens.</p>

            <p>When the House was founded, they resided in a house in downtown Georgetown. In 1972, the college built a residential dorm  on south campus for PHA, and it has been there ever since. PHA members remain true to the values that the House was founded on by being heavily involved in numerous campus organizations, sports teams, and extracurriculars. In addition, they maintain an average GPA of 3.529 (per Spring 2018 grade report). The President's House Association is an organization that its members are very proud to be involved in, and it is an organization that any person who wants to share in these values and experiences should join.</p>
